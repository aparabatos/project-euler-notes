# Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Idea
Find the sum of all the Fibonacci sequence even numbers, that don't exceed four
million. The Fibonacci sequence starts with two numbers 1 and 2, in this case,
and the next term is the sum of the previous two numbers.

## Aproach
1. Declare the first two numbers n1 and n2.

2. Check if n2 is even add to the sum.

3. Continue the loop until `n2 > 4000000`, executing the step 2 every iteration

## Insights
* Loops make series sums very easy to understand, and in some situation loop
through the series is the only possible way

## Reflectiosn
This Aproach taught me to write a simple loop with few steps as possible.
